## Synopsis
My Portfolio is a website used to showcase my personality, skills and experience for prospective employers.

## Motivation
Delivered by Coderfactory Academy, this project was used to apply skills and techniques covering HTML, CSS and heuristic evaluation.

## Target Demographic & Conveyance
The target audience for 'My Portfolio' will be for potential clients and businesses seeking a full stack developer. Throughout the website, I communicate to the audience that I can deliver a high-quality service, and have a modern, casual, functional approach through the design of the website.

### Strategy ###
The website must convey my personal traits and attributes:

#### Appreciates functional design ####
The experience must responsive for ALL mobiles, tablets and computers. It should also be compatible with all browsers.

#### Perfectionist ####
* Ensure the page does not have any latency or layout issues.
* Ensure that all elements displayed are strictly positioned and scaled.
* Perform multiple rounds of testing before passing.

#### Minimalist ####
Each page must not have too much information without compromising the delivery of the content. Details should be kept to a bare minimum to keep the user engaged. Refrain from using too many images, line strokes, inconsistent colour schemes and too many fonts.
**Note:** Review and share with other students, and ask if the page feels 'overloaded'.

#### Analytical thinker ####
Ensure the language used is grammatically perfect and concise. The HTML/CSS code should also be as simplified as possible, cohesive and must reflect strategic usage. It's also important to keep it legible and easy to update and modify.

#### Friendly and approachable, not too intimidating ####
Include sans-serif fonts and casual phrases in the design to deter users from thinking the site is too formal. Large pictures and images will also deliver a relaxed and interpersonal experience. On the Contacts page (last page), leave a line/phrase that encourages the user to engage and remember the website.

### Design/Inspiration ###
From a visual perspective, a simple, flat look will be implemented. Include Sans-Serif fonts, short and casual paragraphs and sentences. Lines and strokes will be used to 'enhance' an element i.e.: the floating navbar or stroke on personal profile picture.

### Approach ###
I have added a gallery of my current work, and listed my previous employment and educational history to justify my current skill set. These will be updated as I continue creating and developing my skills throughout the course.
Ideally, the experience subliminally displays a glimpse of my professional and casual personality.
